# Machine Learning Model Deployment using Streamlit

Machine learning models are powerful tools for making predictions and finding insights from data. However, deploying these models can be a daunting task, especially for those without a background in software engineering. In this blog post, we will explore how to deploy a machine learning model using Streamlit, a powerful open-source framework for building web applications.
We will focus on deploying a Random Forest Classifier, a popular algorithm for classification problems, and optimize its hyperparameters to improve its performance.
